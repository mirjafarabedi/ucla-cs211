\begin{abstract}
OpenWRT is a publicly available Linux distribution for various routers and embedded devices, i.e., a router operating system. Current OpenWRT remote access is handled through ssh command lines or pre-packaged LuCI \cite{LuCI} web interface. However, both of them have limitations. SSH is designed for expert users, and does not provide graphical UI. LuCI Web interface is not touch-friendly and its functionalities are limited. To overcome the limitations, we designed and implemented an Android application for monitoring and configuring OpenWRT APs. We reused the LuCI web interface for its monitoring and configuration functionalities, and built a Python backend to provide per-device per-application traffic statistics. We provided demonstrations for the frontend application, the UI designs for future versions of the application, and basic profiling results of the per-device per-application statistics backend. Experiments on both virtual machines and physical machines show that our design and implementation overcomes the limitations of SSH and LuCI web interface, withouting consuming too much system resources.
