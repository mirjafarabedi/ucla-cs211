\section{Conclusion}

In this project we designed and implemented an Android application for configuring an OpenWRT AP, and a Python backend on the AP to provide per-user, per-application statistics.

The Android application communicates with LuCI via http requests, and calls its functions to authenticate a user and configure the AP. The per-application statistics backend gathers input from \textit{tcpdump}, does DNS reverse lookup to decide the DNS names for packet's source and destination IP addresses, and use the DNS name to decide which service provider's application generated the traffic. The Android application also talks with the per-application statistics backend, and provides a visualization of its statistics.

We provided demonstrations of the initial frontend application, the UI designs for future versions of the application, and basic profiling results of the per-application statistics backend.
